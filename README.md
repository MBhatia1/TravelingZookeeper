# TravelingZookeeper

A C++ Project for my EECS 281: Data Structures & Algorithms class which calculates the optimal route between all of the animals in a zoo in order for the zookeeper to feed them in the lowest optimal time. Also calculates the most optimal placement of a water stream to be available to the most animals with the shortest stream. In the bottom left quadrant of the map is the Wild Zone, which due to dangerous animals is caged off. The traveling zookeeper may only enter the zone through an animal cage residing on the edge of the zone.

Includes option to calculate routs via Minimum Spanning Tree, an accurate and most optimal traveling salesman algorithm, and using the nearest insertion heuristic for faster the TSP algorithm.

The program takes in a text file for which the first line is an int representing the number of coordinates, and each following line is a pair of ints representing the x and y coordinates of an animal exhibit.

Due to restrictions from the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan I cannot post my source code. If you are a recruiter insterested in seeing this, please email me at manavb@umich.edu. I have included input files so that you may understand what the problem entailed.
